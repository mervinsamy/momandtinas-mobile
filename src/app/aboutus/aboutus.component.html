<h4>About Us</h4>
<hr/>

<p>
  What started off as a family pastime for a mother and daughter tandem has now developed into a full fledged bakery café business with the aim of satisfying our customers’ cravings for traditional home cooked meals and fresh out of the oven pastries and baked goodies. Prepared with only the freshest ingredients and no preservatives, much care is taken in order to make sure that every dish that comes out of our kitchen stimulates your palate and leaves you with a sense of comfort and satisfaction only good food can provide. Our recipes have been in our family for decades, ensuring that our food has been, and is continually being subjected to, the most discerning of tastes: our relatives.

<p>
  It is the intimate goodness of home-cooked meals and pastries prepared in our home kitchen combined with a desire to provide a cozy, laid back, welcoming and accessible venue for small gatherings with friends and family that constitute the cornerstone of the Mom & Tina’s Lifestyle: a life lived casually with warmth, love, laughter and good food.

  So sink into our couch. Sit back and relax as you wait for your goodies to arrive. Decades of food tradition can’t be wrong… fortunately, you don’t have to wait a lifetime to taste what we’ve been concocting all these years.
